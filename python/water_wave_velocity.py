Exercise 5.29: Explore a complicated function graphically
The wave speed c of water surface waves depends on the length λ of the
waves. The following formula relates c to λ:
c(λ) = �
gλ
2π
�
1 + s
4π2
ρgλ2
�
tanh �2πh
λ
�
. (5.25)
Here, g is the acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s2
), s is the air-water surface
tension (7.9 · 10−2 N/m) , ρ is the density of water (can be taken as
1000 kg/m3
), and h is the water depth. Let us fix h at 50 m. First make
a plot of c(λ) (in m/s) for small λ (0.001 m to 0.1 m). Then make a plot
c(λ) for larger λ (1 m to 2 km. Filename: water_wave_velocity.py."""
