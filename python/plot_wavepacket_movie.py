Exercise 5.31: Animate a wave packet

Display an animation of the function f(x, t) in Exercise 5.26 by plotting
f as a function of x on [−6, 6] for a set of t values in [−1, 1]. Also make
an animated GIF file.
Hint. A suitable resolution can be 1000 intervals (1001 points) along
the x axis, 60 intervals (61 points) in time, and 6 frames per second in
the animated GIF file. Use the recipe in Section 5.3.4 and remember to
remove the family of old plot files in the beginning of the program.
