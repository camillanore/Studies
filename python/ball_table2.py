#Exercise 2.8: Store values from a formula in lists
#This exercise aims to produce the same table of numbers as in Exercise 2.7,
#but with different code. First, store the t and y values in two lists t and
#y. Thereafter, write out a nicely formatted table by traversing the two
#lists with a for loop.
#Hint. In the for loop, use either zip to traverse the two lists in parallel,
#or use an index and the range construction.
#Filename: ball_table2.py.
#Ex2.7y(t) = v0t − 1/2*gt^2
# Use n + 1 uniformly spaced t values throughout the interval [0, 2v0/g].
# use a for loop to produce the table

t=[0,2V*g]

for t in y
    range(0,1)
    y(t) = [v*t − 0.5*g*t^2]
    print t, y
