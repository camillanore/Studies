Exercise 5.12: Plot exact and inexact Fahrenheit-Celsius
conversion formulas
A simple rule to quickly compute the Celsius temperature from the
Fahrenheit degrees is to subtract 30 and then divide by 2: C = (F −30)/2.
Compare this curve against the exact curve C = (F − 32)5/9 in a plot.
Let F vary between −20 and 120. Filename: f2c_shortcut_plot.py.
